Favicon Placeholder

To complete the website, a favicon.ico file needs to be created and added to the root directory.

A favicon is a small icon (typically 16x16, 32x32, or 64x64 pixels) that represents your website in browser tabs, bookmarks, and other UI elements.

For Block Blast, a simple favicon could be designed with:
- Colorful block shapes
- The letters "BB" (for Block Blast)
- A small puzzle piece icon

You can create a favicon using:
1. Online favicon generators like favicon.io
2. Graphic design software like Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop
3. Free tools like GIMP or Canva

Once created, save it as "favicon.ico" and place it in the root directory of your website.

Note: The website already includes the link to the favicon in the HTML head:
<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
